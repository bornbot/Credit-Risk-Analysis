# Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains files and resources for the Credit Risk Analysis (CRA) Dashboard project. The project aims to analyze and visualize credit risk data to support decision-making in financial institutions.

## Project Files

### 1. `credit.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook contains the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps for the credit risk dataset. It includes the following:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Results interpretation

### 2. `credit_risk_dataset.csv`
This CSV file contains the original credit risk dataset used for analysis. The dataset includes various features relevant to credit risk assessment, such as loan amount, borrower income, credit score, etc.

### 3. `Credrisk_newdata.csv`
This CSV file contains new credit risk data to be used for testing or further analysis. It has a similar structure to `credit_risk_dataset.csv` and can be used to validate models or perform additional evaluations.

### 4. `CRA_Dashboard.pbix`
This Power BI file contains the Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights derived from the credit risk data. It includes:
- Key metrics and indicators for credit risk
- Trend analysis over time
- Breakdown of credit risk by different categories (e.g., loan type, borrower demographics)
- Predictive modeling results

## How to Use

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `credit.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Run the notebook cells to perform data analysis and model training.
   - Review the results and insights generated from the analysis.

2. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Open `CRA_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
   - Interact with the dashboard to explore the visualizations and gain insights from the credit risk data.
   - Use the filters and slicers to customize the views and analyze specific aspects of the data.
